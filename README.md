# clj-shout

A Clojure port of the [libshout](http://www.icecast.org/download.php)
library. You can use this library to write a source client, like
[ices](http://www.icecast.org/ices.php), for sending media to a
streaming server.

## Status

This library should be treated as beta.

It currently only has support for streaming MP3 format files over
HTTP.

It has been tested and works well with Icecast 2.3.3.

## Usage

FIXME

## License

Distributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.
